   <h1>The Importance Of Yoga</h1>
   <p> Mental benefits
    Aside from the physical benefits, one of the best benefits of yoga is how it helps a person manage mental health. Most importantly, yoga helps anyone deal with stress, which is known to have devastating effects on the body and mind. According to Dr. Nevins, “Stress can reveal itself in many ways, including back or neck pain, sleeping problems, headaches, drug abuse, and an inability to concentrate”. Yoga can be very effective in developing coping skills. This practice helps people to reach a more positive outlook on their life.
    
    Heightened Concentration
    The improved concentration is one of the many benefits of a calm mind. The survivors of modern life know the importance of concentration because they often find themselves juggling numerous tasks. Meditation is one potent practice for sharpening the focus. In meditation, you bring your attention either to the breath, mantra, or any visual every time your mind wanders.
    
    Strength & Flexibility
    The sedentary lifestyle is the begetting of many physical health problems like limited flexibility, low strength, poor posture, stiffness, and many more. The performance of yoga asanas encourages body movement in different directions, assisting in opening that reduces stiffness, increases joint mobility, and releases pent-up emotions leading to strength and flexibility.
    
    Greater strength and flexibility are crucial for the healthy maintenance of muscles, tissues, and ligaments.
    
    Discipline and Mindfulness in Life
    By implementing the Yamas and Niyamas written in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, you invite more discipline and mindfulness into your living. The five Yamas and Niyamas are the ethical codes of living a virtuous life.
    
    To honor these ethics during the span of life means – being mindful in every action, performing acts with compassion, and living life in the present moment.
